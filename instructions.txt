Compilation Instructions:

* There is a makefile in the directory src/
* This software was written in Ubuntu 16.04, as such it may not compile propely in Windows.

1) Switch into the src/ directory
2) issue the command: "make exe.exe"
3) The program should build just fine.

Game-Play Instructions:

NOTE: This game will usually take up ~1GB of RAM if you're using Alpha Beta pruning, 
      and about 2-4 GB of RAM if you're just doing plain minimax.

ALSO NOTE: If you want to change the depth for the gametree, edit MAX_DEPTH_MINIMAX to
           affect Minimax's depth, or MAX_DEPTH_ABP to affect Alpha-Beta Pruning's depth.
           Then recompile.

1) Start the program in linux by issuing the command "./exe.exe"
2) Select how you would like the AI to build its gametree
3) The program will determine which player is going to play first
4) Enter your move in the form of: block/pos blockdirection
       Ex.: "4/4 4R" places a piece in position four in block 4, then rotates block 4 Right
5) Play the game!
